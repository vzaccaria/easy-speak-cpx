# A simple program to make CPX speak

This repo contains a simplified version of the Talkie software from
Peter Knight, as distributed with the Circuit Playground Express board.

It is composed of two files:

1.  `speech.h`: it is a file with a few audio samples, one for each
    letter of the alphabet.
2.  `main.ino`: a program that makes the CPX speak the work 'ONE'

# Steps to run it.

1.  Be sure to follow [this
    guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/set-up-arduino-ide)
    to install the CPX-Arduino environment.

2.  Download and un-compress this repo on your machine (green button
    "Clone or Download")
    
3. Select the Circuit Playground Express in the "Tools > Boards" Menu
